# Project Workbench

Project Workbench is a new module in Developer Network (DN) designed as a central workspace for managing customer projects and breaking them down into actionable tasks.

## Purpose

- Intake projects from customers
- Breakdown projects into tasks/subtasks
- Track progress, assignments, and dependencies
- Integrate DN resources (Access Gateway, Environment Manager, Issue Queue, etc.) directly into project workflows

## Core Features

- Project intake and requirements gathering
- Task management and Kanban board
- Resource linking (move DN tools/modules into Workbench context)
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Role-based access (customers, developers, admins)
- Integration with existing DN systems
