> **Scalability** **&** **Performance** **Risks**
>
> **Challenge**: Performance bottlenecks as user base grows beyond current infrastructure capacity
>
> **Mitigation**: Microservices architecture with horizontal scaling, load balancing, and performance monitoring
>
> **Contingency**: Pre-configured auto-scaling rules and database read replica implementation
>
> **Security** **&** **Data** **Protection** **Risks**
>
> **Challenge**: Protecting sensitive code repositories, client data, and payment information
>
> **Mitigation**: Multi-layered security with encryption, RBAC, audit logging, and regular security assessments

>
> **Vendor** **&** **Service** **Dependency** **Risks**
>
> **Challenge**: Over-reliance on third-party services (Railway, Firebase, Stripe) creating single points of failure
>
> **Mitigation**: Multi-cloud strategy with portable architecture and redundant service providers
>
> **Contingency**: Disaster recovery procedures with alternative service provider agreements
