# ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

**Global** **Work** **Inequality**

> **Problem**: Many talented developers in underrepresented regions face barriers to finding work due to geographic and economic disparities.
>
> **Impact**: This leads to untapped potential, economic stagnation, and a lack of diversity in the global tech workforce.
>
> **Solution**: The Developer Network aims to break down these barriers by creating a borderless platform where skills and contributions matter more than location. By leveraging technology, we can connect developers with opportunities worldwide.
>
>
>
> **Real-World** **Examples**
>
> **Example** **1**: A skilled software engineer in China is unable to find work due to restrictions and biases associated with his location. Despite his talent and expertise, he faces barriers that prevent him from accessing global opportunities.
>
> **Example** **2**: Customers in the USA are limited to the talent inside the country. They must navigate strict immigration laws to access skilled developers with the expertise they need. This creates inefficiencies and limits innovation.
