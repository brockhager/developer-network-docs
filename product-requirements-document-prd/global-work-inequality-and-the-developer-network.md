# Global Work Inequality and the Developer Network

Global work inequality refers to the uneven distribution of opportunities, resources, and compensation across different regions, demographics, and economic sectors. In software development, this manifests in disparities in access to infrastructure, education, and employment.

The Developer Network aims to break down these barriers by creating a borderless platform where skills and contributions matter more than location. By leveraging technology, we can connect developers with opportunities worldwide.

Through intentional design and policy, the Developer Network promotes accessibility, equity, and collaboration across distributed teams. This approach fosters a more inclusive and diverse developer ecosystem, enabling global talent to contribute effectively and compete on equal footing.
